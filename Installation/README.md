##Installation guide of i2CSMobile OpenCart 2.1 API module

###Pre-Requisites

OpenCart
In this guide we assume that you already have OpenCart 2.x version installed, and you have admin privileges to install OpenCart extensions via Extension Installer. If you face problems while uploading the i2CSMobile extension, please double check for folder permissions of your OpenCart installation.
If you don’t have OpenCart installed, please download and install it first. We used OpenCart 2.1 as the sample OpenCart system for this guide and all screenshots are based on OpenCart 2.1.0.

OCMOD
We use OCMOD to do necessary changes of your system. OCMOD is a system that allows store owners to be able to modify their store by uploading a compressed file that contains XML, SQL and PHP files. It comes with installation of OpenCart 2.x versions and you don’t need to install it separately.
I2CSMobile extension can modify your OpenCart store in a way that it works without changing any of the core files. This means that if i2CSMobile extension is removed none of the original OpenCart files need to be restored or fixed.
For more information about OCMOD please follow this link [https://github.com/opencart/opencart/wiki/Modification-System](https://github.com/opencart/opencart/wiki/Modification-System)
